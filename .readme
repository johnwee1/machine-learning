## Machine learning

### A place to park my attempts at learning ML with sklearn and others

Currently learning the ropes for machine learning, how to clean data and basically how to get a model up and running. For now i'm not so focused on trying to understand the nitty gritty of the underlying estimators available, but i'm definitely trying to learn how to set up pipelines / kfolding just for basic predictions.


Quick start notes for anyone who's interested

After messing around with Python and having Python and its many different installations mess with my system, I've  learnt the hard way that the best way to set up Python in a system is using pyenv so that I can decouple my system from conda while separating brewed python installs for system dependencies

1) Install pyenv, and pyenv-virtualenv using brew
2) Install related python version and create a venv in desired subdir
3) Install required dependencies
